# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

...i have started planning my code more before jumping into writing it. instead of rushing, i now take time 
to understand the problem, break it into smaller parts, and write short comments to guide my thinking. 
this has made my code more organized and easier to debug. 

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

...i still need to improve my time management. Sometimes i start the practicals too late 
and feel rushed, which affects the quality of my work. 
i also want to be more proactive in reviewing past work to reinforce what 
i have learned, rather than just moving on to the next task.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

...i am doing well at following the instructions carefully and applying what i have learned 
in each task. i am also getting better at testing my code thoroughly, especially using 
print statements and checking expected outputs. i have also become more confident with using classes and methods. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

...i need to stop depending too much on the sample answer and instead try solving the problems independently first. 
this way, i can better understand where my gaps are focus on learning 
rather than just completing the task quickly. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

...i would suggest having more small quizzes or challenges that test understanding of key concepts before 
the pracs. this would help reinforce learning and make it easier to apply those concepts during the practical tasks. 
Also, more real-world examples would be great to see how these coding skills connect to future jobs.
